## Barter Options

- I have always been interested in [barter exchanges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barter) [food co-ops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_cooperative), as well as [guilds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild).

- At its core, barter is a cashless trade of either products and or swervices.

- There are at least two parties involved in all barter trades.

- There are many types of barter options to consider prior to spending any money.

  - scaled-up testing
  - executed manually
  - executed in an automated fashion
