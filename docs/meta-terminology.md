- J: I can take action when forewarned

- I: I like to plan everything in advance so that it can be done efficiently
You sent
spontaneity is fun, but proper planning is indispensable
You sent
my weeks are very planned - weekends not so much
Iichi
Iichi Tanaka
So are you free now?
You sent
for what?
You sent
I am still crunching to get things done before I sleep
You sent
but I have time for you, Iichi
You sent
You are excellent.
Iichi
Iichi Tanaka
Like I just said, you need to prepare in advance if there is a good transaction node tomorrow so that we don't miss it
You sent
what time?
You sent
I will put it on my calendar
Iichi
Iichi Tanaka
So I ask you if you have time now I will guide you
You sent
huh?
You sent
what time tomorrow?
You sent
and then what need to be ready by then?
You sent
what am I missing? üôÇ
Iichi
Iichi Tanaka
Tomorrow, in my free time, I will conduct market analysis through differential cryptography through real-time financial market information and recent cryptocurrency information
You sent
souds good
You sent
you plan to evaluate whether to execute a trade or not?
You sent
just give me a little notification so I can try to be a witness
Iichi
Iichi Tanaka
I told you before that I usually use the Kraken exchange to buy coins and then transfer to the ups and downs exchange and when the trading node comes, I can enter the market and trade
You sent
Am I annoying you?
You sent
apparently I am making you repeat yourself?
You sent
ok, so I will be all set up by then to watch from my end
Iichi
Iichi Tanaka
Since you are new to this field, I suggest you use $500-1k as your investment capital
You sent
I still am waiting for paypal $ to move
You sent
and it may take me some time to feel ready to execute a trade
Iichi
Iichi Tanaka
So what you have to do now is to prepare in advance and wait for the arrival of the transaction node
You sent
ok
You sent
for me scenarios where I can learn lessons  trades without risk is a good way to start
You sent
lessons about trades ^
You sent
ooh I just found out that a friend just got a great job - I am happy for her!
Iichi
Iichi Tanaka
Any investment has risks. There is no way to eliminate risks, but risks can reduce their occurrence. As the most basic investor, the most basic responsibility is to minimize the occurrence of risks
You sent
this is like asking me to swim before I have had a swimming lesson
Iichi replied to you
Iichi Tanaka
I can take you to study and explain to you at the same time. This is the most effective way
You sent
good deal
You sent
teaching is hard 

expertise is half the challenge
You sent
you should hear my accent when I speak japanese üòÆ
Iichi replied to you
Iichi Tanaka
If the transfer has not been completed yet, no one is working at the bank and no one is helping you transfer funds. You may have to wait until the bank opens tomorrow to complete the transfer of funds
You sent
I will check in the morning
Iichi
Iichi Tanaka
But we can buy it directly with a bank card
You sent
I am reluctant to spend a penny until I know more
You sent
I simply know almost nothing
You replied to yourself
<nods>
Iichi
Iichi Tanaka
Of course you can check it tomorrow
You sent
Iichi replied to you
Iichi Tanaka
Only learning in practice is the fastest way
You sent
Learning without risk, or throwing my money away?
You sent
I want to learn without risk
You sent
that ought to be obvious by now
You sent
either someone else manages my portfolio and I know nothing, or I need to manage my own and I have a lot to learn
Iichi
Iichi Tanaka
Chinese: I will develop a trading plan that suits your needs. All trading plans are rigorously calculated and analyzed so that we can minimize risk and ensure a steady income
You sent
I am hoping for the latter
You sent
Chinese?
You sent
what does Chinese mean in your last message?
You sent
üòÉ
Iichi
Iichi Tanaka
Of course there are risks associated with investing, the basic responsibility of the investor should be to minimize the incidence of investment risk, there is no way to eliminate the risk, only to reduce its incidence
You sent
there are ways to learn first no risk
You sent
of course I would expect to deal with tat once I feel ready to trade with some knowledge
You sent
this is what everyone would want - scenarios where analytics can be used to help evaluate the wisdom of a given trade
You sent
I feel like a have  a blindfold on, and it needs to slowly be removed.
You sent
I ^
You sent
then with eyes open, I can consider the prospect of trades
Iichi replied to you
Iichi Tanaka
I would say that the last time I read something like this, there was a saying in China that when the profit outweighs the risk, it's a profitable investment because I know how to avoid the risk, I can recoup the loss very quickly, and the reward is part of reducing the risk, and that's what I'm trying to say
You sent
I would watch you and ask questions
You sent
?
Iichi replied to you
Iichi Tanaka
Of course you can tell me if you have any questions
You sent
I am reminded of what we did in 8th grade to learn about the stock market.

We were told to act like we had a $10k budget and pick stocks.

And then watch how our investments performed
You sent
this way we could start to learn without risk
You sent
people are very interested in crypto and gold/platinum
You sent
learning without risk seems to be the way to go, at least to get started
You sent
some bought penny stocks
You sent
some bought blue chip stocks
You sent
but it was all imaginary
You sent
It will be 70 degrees tomorrow in yc üòÆ
Iichi
Iichi Tanaka
No investment is without risk, but I'd like to say that the risk can be minimized, and with my knowledge and experience, I'm sure I can guide you in the right direction and make a profit from it, and I never do anything I'm not sure of
You sent
I am confident that you know your stuff.  I just need to acclimate and learn.
You sent
understood
You sent
this is more about me than about you, really - I have total confidence in you and none in myself üôÇ
You sent
my confidence will grow as I learn
You replied to yourself
(in myself)
You sent
I hope that I am clarifying, but I am not sure if I am.

Let me know
Iichi
Iichi Tanaka
Because you don't fully understand this space, so I know your concerns. You can tell me what you're worried about, and what aspect of cryptocurrency do you want to know more about, and I can answer it for you
You sent
I shared my 2 main concerns
You sent
And I am ignorant of MUCH of this, so I will look forward to learning more
You sent
ethereum?

are there certain cryptocurrencies you like best?
You sent
you can give me an article to read and I will devour it
You sent
that would be much better than me acting like I can choose my own crypto articles
You sent
learning remotely can also be challenging - but I will step up and do my best
You sent
I am afraid my questions are dumb lol
You sent
üòÉ
You sent
my questions always get much better when the terminology and some diagrams are offered
You sent
I look forward to watching - and I wonder how to watch you trade from remotely
Iichi
Iichi Tanaka
Yes, you can tell me what you want to know about cryptocurrency. We trade Bitcoin for the short term and do not need to hold it for the long term
You sent
interesting
You sent
are there certain times that trades are most advantageous - or risk i sless?
You sent
like day vs night
You sent
times when market is less active vs more active?
Iichi replied to you
Iichi Tanaka
I will calculate the transaction nodes by analyzing the market. The transaction nodes are the future rise and fall trends of Bitcoin
You sent
that was clarifing , thx
Iichi
Iichi Tanaka
The node is the correct trading time. Operate at the correct trading time to achieve profits
You sent
the market dynamics and predictions will need to be spelled out - and I dont want to distract you while you are doing that
You sent
You sent
you are edifying me with terinology that you will expect me to use - that is perfect
You sent
terminology ^
You sent
this helps me articulate questions using those terms
Iichi
Iichi Tanaka
Choosing to buy long when prices go up Choosing to buy short when prices go down
You sent
Iichi
Iichi Tanaka
The reason why you are told to prepare in advance is to prevent us from missing the right trading nodes
You sent
ok, so how do you know when to expect the node ?
You sent
and how do you know when you are too late?
Iichi
Iichi Tanaka
I think I just told you that I'm going to use differential cryptography to calculate the correct transaction node using real-time financial information, recent cryptocurrencies, and cryptocurrency prices
Iichi
Iichi Tanaka
When the correct transaction node time I calculated has passed, then I missed it
You sent
so there is a planning/analytics session and then a subsequent time to execute trade
You sent
?
Iichi
Iichi Tanaka
So I'll spend my free time analyzing the market to see if there's any good trade points
You sent
prospecting vs executing ?
Iichi
Iichi Tanaka
Yes
You sent
thx
You sent
once we align on vocab, this will flow
You sent
you are encouraged to set me straight if I fail to understand or use a term properly
You sent
and in addition to terminology, often diagrams are a lifesaver
You sent
but this is great - you are really helping me from where I am
Iichi
Iichi Tanaka
emmmmmmmmmmmm
You sent
üòç
Iichi
Iichi Tanaka
We're just learning from each other and I'm sharing my knowledge and experience
You sent
I am lucky to have you to set me straight!
You sent
rapport will tighten up!
- J: so you can let me know when you are doing the prospecting, and I will be the student <bow>
