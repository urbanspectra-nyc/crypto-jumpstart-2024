-  I: But if you want to follow my lead, then you should take action.
   - I: Tomorrow I will be analyzing the market to see if there are any good trading points that you can prepare for ahead of time

- J: I can take action when forewarned

- I: I like to plan everything in advance so that it can be done efficiently

- J: spontaneity is fun, but proper planning is indispensable; my weeks are very planned - weekends not so much

- I: So are you free now?

- J:for what? I am still crunching to get things done before I sleep.  but I have time for you, Iichi.  You are excellent.
- I: Like I just said, you need to prepare in advance if there is a good transaction node tomorrow so that we don't miss it

- J: what time? I will put it on my calendar

- I: So I ask you if you have time now I will guide you

- J: huh?  what time tomorrow?  and then what need to be ready by then?  what am I missing? 🙂
- I: Tomorrow, in my free time, I will conduct market analysis through differential cryptography through real-time financial market information and recent cryptocurrency information
- J: sounds good - you plan to evaluate whether to execute a trade or not?  just give me a little notification so I can try to be a witness,
- I: told you before that I usually use the Kraken exchange to buy coins and then transfer to the ups and downs exchange and when the trading node comes, I can enter the market and trade
- J Am I annoying you?  apparently I am making you repeat yourself?  ok, so I will be all set up by then to watch from my end

- I: Since you are new to this field, I suggest you use $500-1k as your investment capital.  I still am waiting for paypal $ to move.
- J: and it may take me some time to feel ready to execute a trade
- I: So what you have to do now is to prepare in advance and wait for the arrival of the transaction node
- J: ok - for me scenarios where I can learn lessons for trades without risk is a good way to start
  - J: ooh I just found out that a friend just got a great job - I am happy for her!

- I:  Any investment has risks. There is no way to eliminate risks, but risks can reduce their occurrence. As the most basic investor, the most basic responsibility is to minimize the occurrence of risks

- I: this is like asking me to swim before I have had a swimming lesson
- I: I can take you to study and explain to you at the same time. This is the most effective way
- J: good deal - teaching is hard  - expertise is half the challenge
  - J: you should hear my accent when I speak japanese 😮

- I: If the transfer has not been completed yet, no one is working at the bank and no one is helping you transfer funds. You may have to wait until the bank opens tomorrow to complete the transfer of funds

- J: I will check in the morning

- I: But we can buy it directly with a bank card

- J: I am reluctant to spend a penny until I know more. I simply know almost nothing
- I: Of course you can check it tomorrow.. Only learning in practice is the fastest way

- J: Learning without risk, or throwing my money away?  I want to learn without risk - that ought to be obvious by now
  - J: either someone else manages my portfolio and I know nothing, or I need to manage my own and I have a lot to learn. I am hoping for the latter.

- I: Chinese: I will develop a trading plan that suits your needs. All trading plans are rigorously calculated and analyzed so that we can minimize risk and ensure a steady income

- J: Chinese?  what does Chinese mean in your last message?  😃
- I: Of course there are risks associated with investing, the basic responsibility of the investor should be to minimize the incidence of investment risk, there is no way to eliminate the risk, only to reduce its incidence

- J: there are ways to learn first no risk
  - J: of course I would expect to deal with that once I feel ready to trade with some knowledge
- J: this is what everyone would want - scenarios where analytics can be used to help evaluate the wisdom of a given trade
- J: I feel like a have  a blindfold on, and it needs to slowly be removed.
- J: then with eyes open, I can consider the prospect of trades

- I: I would say that the last time I read something like this, there was a saying in China that when the profit outweighs the risk, it's a profitable investment because I know how to avoid the risk, I can recoup the loss 
     very quickly, and the reward is part of reducing the risk, and that's what I'm trying to say

- J: I would watch you and ask questions ?
- I: Of course you can tell me if you have any questions
- J: I am reminded of what we did in 8th grade to learn about the stock market.  We were told to act like we had a $10k budget and pick stocks.
     And then watch how our investments performed - this way we could start to learn without risk. Many people are very interested in crypto and gold/platinum
     Learning without risk seems to be the way to go, at least to get started.
     Some bought penny stocks
     Some bought blue chip stocks
     But it was all imaginary
             It will be 70 degrees tomorrow in yc 😮
- I: No investment is without risk, but I'd like to say that the risk can be minimized, and with my knowledge and experience,
   I'm sure I can guide you in the right direction and make a profit from it, and I never do anything I'm not sure of
- J: I am confident that you know your stuff.  I just need to acclimate and learn.

- I: understood
- J: this is more about me than about you, really - I have total confidence in you and none in myself 🙂
- J: my confidence will grow as I learn
- J: I hope that I am clarifying, but I am not sure if I am.  Let me know
- I: Because you don't fully understand this space, so I know your concerns. You can tell me what you're worried about, and what aspect of cryptocurrency do you want to know more about, and I can answer it for you

- J: I shared my 2 main concerns
- J: And I am ignorant of MUCH of this, so I will look forward to learning more
- J: ethereum?
- J: are there certain cryptocurrencies you like best?
you can give me an article to read and I will devour it
that would be much better than me acting like I can choose my own crypto articles
learning remotely can also be challenging - but I will step up and do my best
I am afraid my questions are dumb lol
😃

my questions always get much better when the terminology and some diagrams are offered
I look forward to watching - and I wonder how to watch you trade from remotely

- I: Yes, you can tell me what you want to know about cryptocurrency. We trade Bitcoin for the short term and do not need to hold it for the long term
- J: interesting

- J: are there certain times that trades are most advantageous - or risk is sless?  like day vs night
     times when market is less active vs more active?
- I: I will calculate the transaction nodes by analyzing the market. The transaction nodes are the future rise and fall trends of Bitcoin
- J: that was clarifing , thx
- I: The node is the correct trading time. Operate at the correct trading time to achieve profits
- J: the market dynamics and predictions will need to be spelled out - and I dont want to distract you while you are doing that
- J:  you are edifying me with terminology that you will expect me to use - that is perfect
- J: this helps me articulate questions using those terms
- I: Choosing to buy long when prices go up Choosing to buy short when prices go down

- I: The reason why you are told to prepare in advance is to prevent us from missing the right trading nodes
- J: ok, so how do you know when to expect the node ? and how do you know when you are too late?
- I: I think I just told you that I'm going to use differential cryptography to calculate the correct transaction node using real-time financial information, recent cryptocurrencies, and cryptocurrency prices
- I: When the correct transaction node time I calculated has passed, then I missed it

- J: so there is a planning/analytics session and then a subsequent time to execute trade ?
- I: So I'll spend my free time analyzing the market to see if there's any good trade points
- J: prospecting vs executing ?
- I: Yes
- J: thx
- J: once we align on vocab, this will flow
- J: you are encouraged to set me straight if I fail to understand or use a term improperly
- J: and in addition to terminology, often diagrams are a lifesaver
- J: but this is great - you are really helping me from where I am
- I: emmmmmmmmmmmm
- J: 😍
- I: We're just learning from each other and I'm sharing my knowledge and experience
- J: I am lucky to have you to set me straight!  rapport will tighten up!
  - J: so you can let me know when you are doing the prospecting, and I will be the student <bow>
